The challenge was to create a pong table. The basics functionality is infra-red sensors are placed under each cup; when the cup is removed, the receiver reads a weaker signal, which then triggers the centre score to decrease. Extra features include:
•	Danger pong - pong with forfeits.
•	The ability to play mini-games like snake and pong. 
We designed the table and electronics. The legs fold into the table cavity to allow for ease of transportation; there are two main layers within the body, one which houses all the loose wiring and the top one on which the LEDs are placed. The top surface is opaque perspex which allows the intense LED light through while hiding the electronics. There is a 14 x 20 LED matrix in the centre used for the main display. Each sensor is surrounded by three individual LEDs, which it's used not only as a location of the cups to be placed but also change colour to indicate various things. 
We used audrunio microcontrollers programmed using Arduino IDE. These communicate using the I squared C protocol. This allowed us to transfer button presses and sensor information to the main controller. We used the fast LED neo matrix library, allowing us to draw text and other graphics quickly.
